# Instructions
You can complete the exercises by writing your code, where you will find the following comments.
```
### START YOUR CODE HERE
variable_name = None
some_func(variable_name)
### END YOUR CODE HERE
```

The solution branch shows all the solutions.

# Requirements
You can install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file. 

You can also run it on a Docker container if you want! :)

# Solutions
You can check the solutions in the `solutions` branch. If you are not familiar with git, you can clone this repo as follows.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lucamaiano/visiope.git
```
You can switch branches with this command:
```
$ cd visiope
$ git checkout $branch
```
where `$branch` is an existing branch (i.e., `solution` or `main` for this repo).
